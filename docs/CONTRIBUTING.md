# Contributing
The following is an organized guide on how you can help contribute to the project.

## Suggesting Features
We'd love to hear your feedback on what you think the next best feature could be (or even just what a feature you'd like to see is)! If you have an idea for a feature, feel free to submit a new issue with the idea(s) you may have. Please, however, ensure that you search that the feature you're suggesting has not already been suggested. This ensures that when tracking development we can do it through a single issue, rather than numerous issues with different ideas. If an idea you have is already in the issue tracker, feel free to add any extra feedback you may have to the relevant issue!

## Reporting Bugs/Issues
We're not perfect and sometimes little bugs sneak under our radar. If you happen to find them, please create a new issue and let us know so we can squash it! Before reporting, please ensure your issue has not already been reported. If it has, add your feedback/information to the relevant issue. This ensures that issues are marked as fixed the first time and different information isn't spread accross multiple issues.

## Submitting Pull Requests
Want to fix an issue for us? Add a new feature? Or just want to translate something? Feel free to submit a Pull Request! Reviewing your submission may take some time depending on what you added/changed, so please be patient with us and we will eventually get around to reviewing it.
